# SoMo P5

This is a reimplementation of [SoMo](https://bitbucket.org/mmoritz/somo/src/master/ "SoMo Bitbucket Repository") in [Processing P5](https://p5js.org/ "Processing P5 Website").

# Overview

SoMo is designed as a musical instrument to be controlled by movement, with very fast responsivity. As with any, the development of artistic expression passes through becoming familiar with the instrument.

It captures the movement in camera and maps it into sound and image.
